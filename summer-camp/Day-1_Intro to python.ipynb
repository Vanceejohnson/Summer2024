    "Python is a programming language that has been growing in popularity in recent years. There are many reasons for this, but it mostly comes down to Python being easy to learn and use as well as the fact that Python has a very active community that continually develops and improves amazing extensions to Python!\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has become one of the most frequently used languages in the world of data science due to the ability to almost instantly apply it to a large number of data science problems. When asking stakeholders in companies in different industries and of various sizes what language they would like their data scientists to know when coming in, they almost all agree that Python is the best choice. If you are going to learn one language (something everyone should do!), Python would be a great choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this language, other languages, features and packages have been created: Ipython, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and others that we will be using during this course. For more info please visit https://www.python.org/doc/\n"
